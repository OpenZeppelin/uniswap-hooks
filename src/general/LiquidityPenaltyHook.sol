/**
 * @dev This hook implements a mechanism penalize liquidity provision based on time of adding and removing of liquidity.
 * The main purpose is to prevent JIT (Just in Time) attacks on liquidity pools. Specifically,
 * it checks if a liquidity position was added to the pool within a certain block number range (at least 1 block)
 * and if so, it donates some of the fees to the pool (up to 100% of the fees) if the action is for removing liquidity.
 * In case of liquidity addition in the block range, the hook retrieves the fees from the liquidity provider but instead
 * of donating them back to the pool, it holds the claims in the hook contract until the liquidity is removed, when the accrued fees are sent to the proper LPer.
 * this is done that way in order to only penalize add and remove liquidity actions in the block range and not multiple additions by the same liquidity provider.
 * This way, the hook effectively taxes JIT attackers by donating their expected profits back to the pool on liquidity removal.
 * Note that if the liquidity is added after the block number offset, the hook will not hold the accrued fees and the protocol will work as expected, returning the fees.
 * The hook calculates the fee donation based on the block number when the liquidity was added
 * and the block number offset.
 *
 * At constructor, the hook requires a block number offset. This offset is the number of blocks at which the hook
 * will donate the fees to the pool. The minimum value is 1.
 *
 * NOTE: The hook donates the fees to the current in range liquidity providers (at the time of liquidity removal).
 * If the block number offset is much later than the actual block number when the liquidity was added, the
 * liquidity providers who benefited from the fees will be the ones in range at the time of liquidity removal, not
 * the ones in range at the time of liquidity addition.
 *
 * WARNING: This is experimental software and is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. We do
 * not give any warranties and will not be liable for any losses incurred through any use of this code
 * base.
